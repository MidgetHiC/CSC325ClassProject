# User Persona Directory

## Overview

The **User Persona Directory** is a strategic resource designed to help undergraduate computer science students identify key personas. This directory plays a crucial role in showcasing a student's technical skills, improving hiring decisions, and ensuring that portfolios align with industry expectations. By defining distinct user personas, students can create personal website portfolios that effectively highlight their expertise, while employers can use these insights to evaluate potential candidates for internships or job opportunities.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the User Persona Directory is to provide structured insights into different user types that interact with or benefit from website portfolios. By leveraging these personas, students and hiring managers can:

- **Enhance Portfolio Design:** Understand what hiring managers look for in a candidate’s website portfolio, from project showcases to technical skills.
- **Optimize Job Search Strategies:** Help students tailor their portfolios to highlight the most relevant projects, skills, and experiences that appeal to potential employers.
- **Improve Hiring Decisions:** Assist recruiters and startup owners in assessing computer science students based on their online portfolios, technical capabilities, and personal branding.
- **Streamline User-Centered Design:** Guide students in structuring their portfolios effectively by considering user experience (UX), accessibility, and industry expectations.
- **Support Career Growth:** Provide a roadmap for students to build an online presence that increases their chances of securing internships or full-time roles.

## Structure

Each persona in the directory follows a structured format:

- **Name:** A fictional but representative name to humanize the persona.
- **Demographics:** Key details such as age, location, education level, and technical expertise.

- **Scenario(s):** A real-world situation, such as a student preparing their portfolio for an upcoming job fair or a startup founder evaluating candidates for a development role.
